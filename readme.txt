== The only plugin you need to improve and ajaxify your WooCommerce Product Search ==

Live search
Provides the possibility to search with autocomplete results

Standart WooCommerce widget
Works with the standard WooCommerce Product Search widget. You don't need additional settings.


== The only Search plugin with the auto correction of the input errors ==

With the help of this plugin, the products search results within your store will be as relevant as possible for your potential customers. With our plugin, you no longer have to create the databases of synonyms and duplicate the words with common mistakes in the product name or its description.

For example, if your potential customer searches for “Aple” or “Appl”, instead of “No products found”, the plugin will show the Apple products in the results, if you have them in your store.


Premmerce Product Search for WooCommerce has the following correction features:

* Spell correction
* Search for the similar words
* Search for the words with the same pronunciation
* Search for the transliterated words

== Additionally enjoy the following Premium Features ==

* Setting up the minimum number of symbols to start the live search
* Setting up the number of live search (autocomplete) results
* Product search by its SKU
* Product search by its short description
* The ‘All search results’ button

== Premium Version last update details ==

* Hide out of stock items from live search
Most of the users are turning to the e-shops in search of something available at the click of a mouse. After all, this is one of the main advantages of online shopping. That's why it's better to hide the things that are out of stock. They don't have any positive influence on the brand's reputation and only confuse someone who's trying to make a satisfying choice. Leaving such items out of the live search and, thus, out of sight solves the problem.
* Show image in live search
The live search in itself is a powerful tool to take into account but make just a few tweaks - and it takes you to a whole other level. This is one of them. Displaying an image along the search results engages the visual element that can be handy. If you're confident in its quality, it would be imprudent to ignore such a function and not to make use out of the whole product image.
* Show price in live search
Displaying price in the autocomplete form is another add-on to get value out of. This criterion is one of the most deciding and seeing it right away won't scare customers, instead, it can become an extra push to place an order. The display of attractive numbers is quite convincing and our WooCommerce Product Search acknowledges their potential.
* "Add to cart" in live search
Finally, this is the one upgrade to go for. Either working on its own or stacked on top of the previous features, this is a mighty addition to have on the site. Just imagine that someone in search of a thing, all he has to do is to start typing and choose from the drop-down variants. If he finds something desired, the "Add to cart" button won't go unnoticed.
